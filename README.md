# FreeTV
HF radio image transmission using the FreeDV modem

This program is in very, very early stages of development. Expect bugs, and use on the air at your own risk!

# Installation
Install python 3 on your system. Then, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the root directory of this repository. *You might want to do this in a python virtual environment!*
Then run `freetv.py`, or you may choose to convert to a standalone executable by running `python setup.py build`. This will run cx_freeze (automatially installed from requirements.txt) to build the app.
